RGB-Colour-Simulator
I made this to illustrate how computers handle colour and RGB values. 
The user is given knobs for red, green, and blue. Each with adjustable values from 0 to 255. 
The colours  change in real-time and blended in the "mixed" box. The user can make any colour by manipulating the GUI. 
The colours could then be reset, saved, and deleted according to user input.
